# StoryTracker - Core Application

Developed by Nicholas Pickering

StoryTracker is a story organization tool for fiction authors. 

StoryTracker is developed on a custom PHP framework, with a MySQL database. 

I fell in love with writer culture after my wife began working on her first novel.

Together, we came up with the concept for Story Tracker: a web application to solve the analytical and practical issues of writing a novel, and getting out of the way when creative forces need control.
